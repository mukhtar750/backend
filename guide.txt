Arya Nigeria Mentorship Guide
Arya Nigeria is poised to become a unique women-focused support platform in the country. By 
facilitating and preparing women for “Smart Money” investments, the platform brings companies led 
by women together with mentors, trainers and angel investors (all called Arya Nigeria Leaders) that 
can add value to their ventures beyond financial resources. Arya Nigeria’s power comes from the 
ability to leverage financial as well as professional resources of Arya Nigeria Leaders together to 
accelerate entrepreneurs’ businesses.
Arya Nigeria focuses on three (3) major actions:
Investment - Invest
Accelerates prospective women-led companies with a specific focus on investment readiness and 
connects them with investors.
Training and Mentoring - Learn
Organises trainings on investment processes, financial insights gathering, evaluation, expectation 
management and mentorship for entrepreneurs and investors.
Events - Inspire
Apart from trainings, Arya Nigeria organises events for motivation, awareness raising and networking 
in suitable venues. 
Arya Nigeria Leader Manifesto
The platform works to enable women-led businesses scale up and become investment-ready. We 
serve as a bridge between female entrepreneurs and the successful women and men who invest 
their time, experiences, networks and capital in accordance with our vision and values. Our objective 
is to close the funding gap by creating more female investors and decision-makers as well as success 
stories. As Arya Nigeria, we know that we cannot walk this road alone and believe that we are 
stronger together. We are held together by our values; encapsulated under “Arya Woman.” 
An Arya Woman is …
1. Open-Minded
She knows that there is not only one (1) truth, is open to a new mind-set and feedback, can 
empathize and, open communication is important to her. Her priority is speaking to understand, 
not to be understood.
2. Trustworthy
A promise is a promise! She is fair and honest, makes decisions in accordance to her principles 
not to her ego and makes a difference with her work ethics and communication skills.
3. Entrepreneurial
She knows how to work hard and play hard, knows all work is measured with metrics and shares 
the results fearlessly. She is good at accomplishing her goals and sees opportunities where 
others see problems.
4. Brave
She fights for the ones she loves and what she believes in. Always eager to learn, she stands 
with the right people, shapes her life with her own rules and not with the rules of others.
5. Sincere
She accepts herself the way she is, embraces her authenticity and knows that diversity means 
growing while getting stronger. Her feedback is constructive and sincere.

6. Creative
She believes everything is possible and can find creative ways to source the resources required 
for her projects. She is proactive and believes in her power not destiny. She does not wait for 
someone to give her but creates opportunities and takes them.
7. Impactful
She likes to be successful while touching other people’s lives and leaving positive impact on 
them. She does not only think about herself but others as well. She is socially responsible and 
works hard to lead change.
8. Sharer
She knows that power gets stronger when it is shared with others and giving makes her even 
richer. She only offers what she is willing to give and believes in collaborative intelligence. She 
is generous and chooses to shine together, not alone. 
In accordance with the above stated values, as “Arya Women”, we make a promise to:
§ act with good intentions;
§ be honest and fair;
§ be consistent with our words and actions;
§ be good representatives of the Arya Values;
§ believe in getting stronger together and mutual support;
and, be proud “Arya Leaders”!
Arya Nigeria for Entrepreneurs
Each step of the investment process of the platform is a learning process. Arya Nigeria investors are 
entrepreneurial investors and they can understand the processes that entrepreneurs are undertaking 
pretty well.
A typical investment process takes at least six (6) months. When an investment decision is to be 
made for an enterprise, meetings with a mentor(s) are held and the enterprise undergoes monitoring. 
Targets are defined with the entrepreneur and evaluated for the agreed period. Even if the process 
does not end up with investment, during this time, constructive feedback and mentorship are provided 
for the enterprise. For an enterprise that secures investment, assistance in areas such as business 
development and digital strategy is provided.
All the entrepreneurs that apply for investments can benefit from the platform’s business network and
mentorship as well as other facilities that are available for entrepreneurs.
Arya Nigeria for Investors
Arya Nigeria investors are successful business people and enterprise investors. They are prominent 
men and women of their sectors who have established their businesses and have walked the 
pathways that entrepreneurs are going through now.
While experiencing the investment process along with offering mentorship, the investors can 
accelerate the companies that they work with. Investors with the mind-set of; learn a little, do a bit of 
favour and earn a little can have opportunities to be part of small companies’ success stories.
Arya Nigeria for Professionals
People who want to invest in different fields other than their own professions with their experience, 
networks and time can be trainers, mentors or consultants as Arya Nigeria Leaders and can be 
committee members. This way, they can learn something new from entrepreneurs while making 
impact their lives.

Arya Nigeria for Corporates
Organisations/Agencies willing to help women, create employment and contribute to the economy 
can assist Arya Nigeria through sponsorship, networking and pro-bono work. They can sponsor 
events, provide digital or off-line contents, directly support entrepreneurs or simply join the
mentorship programme of Arya Nigeria.
Arya Mentoring Process
Our mentoring process entails the five (5) steps indicated below (we kindly ask participating mentors 
and mentees to copy (CC) nigeria@aryawomen.com mail address for all correspondence):
Before the Interview
We recommend that you make preliminary preparations and review all materials shared with you. 
The Arya Nigeria Secretariat proposes mentor/mentee matchups while considering what the 
demands and expectations are. Upon approval by the Arya Nigeria Steering Group, each pair is
introduced via e-mail along with already completed business summary and mentorship application 
forms that provide information about the mentee’s enterprise and why she wants mentoring. This is 
the right time for the mentor or mentee to ask questions they may want answered before the first 
meeting and, to agree the medium (physical or virtual) and time of the meeting.
First Meeting
The first meeting, which is very important, is to understand the mentee, increase her awareness, 
determine expectations and specify how to measure them. In this context, filling in the following forms 
containing some information for the tasks to be undertaken by the mentee will contribute to progress:
• Mentorship Agreement (Form 1)
• Success Description (Form 2)
• Growth Area Identification (Form 3)
• Core Values Determination (Form 4)
• 5-year Vision Determination (Form 5)
• Question Card for Determination of Competitive Advantage in The Market (Form 6)
Subsequent Meetings
In light of the framework drawn in the initial contact between the mentor and the mentee, meetings 
are made about the envisaged targets. The main goals of these meetings are to take actions and 
keep the entrepreneur on track by checking and controlling previous actions each time. Therefore, 
you can do a Canvas (quick reference: https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/quick-and-dirty-guide-to-the￾business-model-canvas) or Current Situation Analysis using Form 7 (this form is suitable for small 
companies that the Business Model Canvas is difficult to determine or does not apply to). Forms 8 - 10 are 
to be used subsequently as applicable. Remember to specify SMART (Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound) targets.
• Company Current Situation Assessment (Form 7) 
• Meeting Notes (Form 8)
• Homework Tracking (Form 9)
• Action Plan (Form 10)
• Mentor/Mentee Feedback (Form 11)
• Suggested Readings/Videos/Other Resources (Form 12)
Last Meeting
You will be able to evaluate the whole process by doing this meeting face-to-face (if possible). "What 
were our goals? Did we achieve these goals?" type of questions will trigger a search for answers.
Evaluation
You will have to provide feedback using Form 11 to help us evaluate your journey. This will be used 
by Arya Nigeria Steering Group and Secretariat to improve on the mentorship process.

What to Send to Stakeholders
> We will embed the 12 mentorship forms as a digital “Mentorship Journey” in the portal. Each mentor-mentee pair will have a private, step-by-step workflow with all forms, progress tracking, and digital signatures. Forms will be grouped by phase (setup, ongoing, feedback), and both parties can fill, save, and review them online. Admins can monitor progress and download reports. This structure ensures a professional, user-friendly, and fully trackable mentorship process.
