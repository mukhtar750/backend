# Change Log

This log details the modifications made to the Laravel backend to integrate with a React frontend.

## 2024-07-30

### 1. CORS Configuration (`config/cors.php`)

*   Enabled CORS by setting `supports_credentials` to `true`.
*   Configured `allowed_origins` to `['https://aryaas.netlify.app']` to allow requests from your React frontend.
*   Ensured correct placement and removed duplicate entries for `allowed_origins`, `supports_credentials`, `exposed_headers`, and `max_age` to maintain a clean and functional configuration.

### 2. Environment Variables (`.env`)

*   Created the `.env` file by copying content from `.env.example`.
*   Updated `SESSION_DOMAIN` to `.onrender.com`.
*   Updated `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` to `aryaas.netlify.app`.
*   Applied the full `.env` content provided by you, including `APP_KEY`, `DB_DATABASE`, and other configurations.

### 3. API Routes (`routes/api.php`)

*   Created `routes/api.php` (as it was missing).
*   Added a test route `Route::get('/test', function () { return response()->json(['message' => 'API test route working!']); });`.
*   Added `use App\Http\Controllers\AuthController;` import.
*   Implemented login route: `Route::post('/login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);`.
*   Implemented user route: `Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->get('/user', function (Request $request) { return $request->user(); });`.

### 4. Authentication Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php`)

*   Created `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php` (as it was missing).
*   Implemented the `login` method to handle user authentication.

### 5. Frontend Asset Removal (`resources/views/landing.blade.php`)

*   Commented out the `@vite` directive to prevent the loading of frontend assets (CSS/JS) from the Blade view, as the backend is serving as an API.

### 6. Root Route Update (`routes/web.php`)

*   Modified the root route (`/`) to return a simple JSON message `{"message": "Backend is running"}` instead of a Blade view, which is appropriate for an API-only backend.
